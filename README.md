This is the game Snake.
There is a road with three lanes. Cars of various sizes, motorcycles and trucks are spawned randomly.
The player is a car. You can change the size of the car.
The other vehicles are going in the opposite direction.
The player has to avoid the other vehicles. The longer he can avoid them, the more points he gets and faster the other vehicles go.
When you hit a vehicle, the game is over.
The highest score is kept and changes if a new highscore is reached. The highscore depends on the size.

Pygame was used for the graphics.
